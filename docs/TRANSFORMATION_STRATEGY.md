| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Users** | 50K | 200K | 500K | 1.2M | 2.5M |

| **Margin** | 20% | 44% | 58% | 68% | 73% |

### 9.4 Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed Costs (Monthly):**
- Personnel: $750K
- Infrastructure: $200K
- Offices: $150K
- Marketing: $300K
- **Total Fixed:** $1.4M/month

**Variable Costs:**
- Transaction costs: 0.02% of volume
- Support costs: $5 per user per month

**Break-Even Calculation:**
```
Monthly Revenue Required = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs
$1.4M + ($100M × 0.0002) + (10,000 × $5)
= $1.4M + $20K + $50K
= $1.47M

At 0.15% avg fee:
Break-even Volume = $1.47M / 0.0015 = $980M/month

Expected: Month 16-18 (as volume scales)
```

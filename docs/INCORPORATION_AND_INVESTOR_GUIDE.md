### 2.4 Negotiating Investment Terms

**1. Valuation**
```
Pre-Money Valuation: $200M (target)
├── Justification: Comparable companies, traction, market size
├── Negotiation Range: $150M - $250M
└── Impact: Determines ownership percentage

Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money + Investment
$250M = $200M + $50M
Investor Ownership = $50M / $250M = 20%
```

**2. Liquidation Preference**
```
Options:
a) 1x Non-Participating (INVESTOR-FRIENDLY, RECOMMENDED)
   - Investors get $50M back first, then participate pro-rata
   
b) 1x Participating
   - Investors get $50M back, then 20% of remaining
   
c) 2x or higher (AVOID)
   - Investors get $100M back first (very founder-unfriendly)

Recommendation: Negotiate for 1x non-participating
```

**3. Board Composition**
```
Options:
a) Founder-Controlled (3 founders, 2 investors, 2 independent)
b) Investor-Controlled (2 founders, 3 investors, 2 independent)
c) Balanced (3 founders, 3 investors, 1 independent) - RECOMMENDED

Recommendation: Balanced board maintains founder influence while giving investors oversight
```

**4. Anti-Dilution Protection**
```
Options:
a) Full Ratchet (AVOID) - Very investor-friendly
   - If down round, investors get repriced to new lower valuation
   
b) Weighted Average (RECOMMENDED)
   - Investors get partial protection based on size of down round
   
c) No Anti-Dilution (Rare)

Recommendation: Negotiate weighted average anti-dilution
```

**5. Vesting and Cliff**
```
Founder Vesting:
├── 4-year vesting schedule
├── 1-year cliff (25% vests after year 1)
├── Monthly vesting thereafter
└── Acceleration on change of control (negotiate)

Recommendation: Accept vesting but negotiate single-trigger acceleration on M&A
```

**6. Pro-Rata Rights**
```
Meaning: Investors can maintain ownership % in future rounds

Example:
├── Investor owns 20% after Series A
├── Series B raises more capital
├── Investor has right to invest to maintain 20%

Recommendation: Grant pro-rata rights to Series A investors (standard)

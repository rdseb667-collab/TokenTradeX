  - Platform Share (85%): $791  
  - Holder Share (15%): $140  
  - *Note: 0.08% maker + 0.12% taker, but volume weighted toward taker (70% market orders) + both sides pay fees on matched trades = effective 0.239% on GMV

### Unit Economics
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: $1.52/month  
  - Calculation: $5,846 MRR ÷ 3,847 users  
  - Paying users only (81 subs + 891 traders): $6.56/month

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: $8.50  
  - Organic: $2.30 (referrals, 60% of signups)  
  - Paid: $18.70 (Twitter/Discord ads, 40% of signups)

- **Gross Margin**: 92% (platform costs: hosting $450, payment processing $350/mo)  
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: $50.16  
  - Calculation: $1.52 ARPU × 92% margin × 36 months avg lifespan  
  - Conservative cohort: 28% D30 retention → 36-month avg  
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: 5.7x (excellent, SaaS benchmark 3x+)  
  - $50.16 LTV ÷ $8.86 CAC = 5.66x

### Fee Structure Breakdown (Transparency)
**Why 0.239% effective rate on GMV when base is 0.08-0.12%?**

1. **Maker Fee**: 0.08% (8 bps)  
2. **Taker Fee**: 0.12% (12 bps)  
3. **Volume Mix**: 70% market orders (taker), 30% limit (maker)  
   - Weighted avg: (0.7 × 0.12%) + (0.3 × 0.08%) = 0.108%  
4. **Both Sides Pay**: On a matched trade, both buyer AND seller pay fees  
   - Effective rate: 0.108% × 2 = 0.216% on GMV  
5. **Withdrawal Fees**: 0.5-2% add ~0.023% to blended rate  
   - Total: 0.216% + 0.023% = **0.239% blended**  

**Math Check**: $389K GMV × 0.239% = $930 fees ✓  
(Actual: $931 trading + $247 withdrawal = $1,178 total; $931 shown is trading only)

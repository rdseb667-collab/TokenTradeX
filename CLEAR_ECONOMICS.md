## 💰 REVENUE SPLIT (Crystal Clear):

### Every Trade (0.08-0.12% fee):
- **85% → PLATFORM** (you keep this, direct profit)
- **15% → TTX HOLDERS** (auto-distributed proportionally)

### Clean Separation (TTXUnified.sol):
- **TTX Token Fees** → Auto-compound for stakers (on-chain)
- **ETH/Cash Fees** → Reserve for buybacks (on-chain)
- **All tracked separately** → No mixing units, no over-distribution
- **Donation-attack proof** → Uses transferFrom, never balanceOf(this)

### Why This Wins:
✅ **You profit immediately** (85% of every trade)  
✅ **Holders rewarded** (15% share creates demand)  
✅ **Transparent & quotable** (no confusion)  
✅ **Sustainable** (not giving away equity, just revenue share)  
✅ **Safe math** (TTX rewards from TTX fees only, ETH reserve separate)  
✅ **Secure** (No donation attacks, 10% withdrawal limits, flexible unstaking)  

### The Math (Conservative Year 3):
- **Platform Volume**: $17.5B/year (500K users, $100/day avg)  
- **Trading Fees**: $175M at 0.1% avg  
- **Platform Revenue**: $148.75M (85%)  
- **Holder Revenue**: $26.25M (15%, distributed)  
- **Other Streams**: +$50M (subscriptions, listings, API, margin)  
- **Total Platform Revenue**: **$198.75M/year**  
- **EBITDA**: **$135M at 68% margin**

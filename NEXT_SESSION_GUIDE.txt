TTX TOKEN - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR NEXT SESSION
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Smart contracts ready (TTXReserveToken.sol, TokenizedPosition.sol)
✅ Backend revenue flywheel working (10 streams)
✅ Frontend showing revenue model
✅ Both servers running successfully
✅ DEX integration service ready

================================================================================
NEXT SESSION: DEPLOY TTX TO PANCAKESWAP (BSC)
================================================================================

PREPARATION NEEDED (Before Next Session):
------------------------------------------

1. GET BNB FOR GAS FEES
   - Need: $50-100 worth of BNB
   - Where: Buy on Binance, transfer to MetaMask
   - Purpose: Pay for contract deployment and liquidity pool creation

2. GET BUSD FOR LIQUIDITY PAIRING
   - Need: $5,000-10,000 BUSD
   - Where: Binance or swap BNB → BUSD on PancakeSwap
   - Purpose: Pair with TTX to create trading pool

3. SETUP METAMASK
   - Install MetaMask browser extension
   - Add BSC network to MetaMask:
     * Network Name: BSC Mainnet
     * RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
     * Chain ID: 56
     * Symbol: BNB
     * Block Explorer: https://bscscan.com

4. CREATE DEPLOYER WALLET
   - Create new MetaMask wallet for deployment
   - SAVE private key securely (will need for .env)
   - Transfer BNB + BUSD to this wallet

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT STEPS (We'll Do Together Next Session):
================================================================================

STEP 1: SETUP HARDHAT FOR BSC
------------------------------
Files to create:
- hardhat.config.js (BSC network config)
- .env file with DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY

Commands we'll run:
cd c:\Users\pcpcp\Downloads\TokenTradeX\contracts
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npx hardhat compile

STEP 2: DEPLOY TTX CONTRACT TO BSC
-----------------------------------
We'll run:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-ttx-token.js --network bsc

Expected output:
- Contract address (save this!)
- Deployment cost: ~$5-10 in BNB

STEP 3: VERIFY CONTRACT ON BSCSCAN
-----------------------------------
Makes contract readable/trustworthy

We'll run:
npx hardhat verify --network bsc [CONTRACT_ADDRESS]

STEP 4: CREATE LIQUIDITY POOL ON PANCAKESWAP
---------------------------------------------
Two options:

Option A: Use PancakeSwap UI (Easier)
1. Go to https://pancakeswap.finance/add
2. Connect MetaMask
3. Select TTX token (paste contract address)
4. Select BUSD
5. Enter amounts:
   - 100,000 TTX
   - $10,000 BUSD
   (This sets price at $0.10 per TTX)
6. Approve + Add Liquidity

Option B: Use our DEX service (Programmatic)
We'll call: dexIntegrationService.createLiquidityPool()

STEP 5: TTX IS NOW TRADABLE!
-----------------------------
Share with users:
- Contract address: [YOUR_ADDRESS]
- Trading link: https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=[YOUR_ADDRESS]
- Chart: https://dexscreener.com/bsc/[YOUR_ADDRESS]

================================================================================
COST SUMMARY:
================================================================================

Contract Deployment:     $5-10 (BNB gas)
Liquidity Pool Creation: $2-5 (BNB gas)
Initial Liquidity:       $10,000 (BUSD) + 100,000 TTX

TOTAL CASH NEEDED:       ~$10,020
TOTAL TIME:              30-60 minutes

================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Day 1):
- TTX appears on DexScreener automatically
- Anyone can trade TTX/BUSD on PancakeSwap
- You earn 0.25% of every trade (LP fees)

WEEK 1-2:
- Submit to CoinGecko (free listing)
- Submit to CoinMarketCap (free listing)
- Share on Twitter/Telegram
- Track on DexTools

MONTH 1-2:
- Apply to MEXC (small CEX, $0-5K listing fee)
- Apply to Gate.io Startup (community vote, free)
- Build trading volume

MONTH 3-6:
- Apply to KuCoin ($30-100K fee)
- Consider marketing campaigns
- Possibly Binance if volume is strong

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:
================================================================================

IF CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT FAILS:
- Check you have enough BNB for gas
- Verify hardhat.config.js has correct network
- Try increasing gas price

IF LIQUIDITY POOL CREATION FAILS:
- Approve TTX spending first
- Approve BUSD spending first  
- Make sure you have enough of both tokens
- Check slippage tolerance (set to 1%)

IF NOBODY CAN BUY TTX:
- Verify liquidity pool was created
- Check contract isn't paused
- Verify on BSCScan that pool exists

================================================================================
BACKUP PLAN (If Not Ready):
================================================================================

Can deploy to BSC TESTNET first:
- Free test BNB from faucet
- Practice deployment
- No real money risk
- Network: BSC Testnet (Chain ID: 97)

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
================================================================================

1. PRIVATE KEY SECURITY
   - Never share private key
   - Don't commit to git
   - Use .env file (already in .gitignore)

2. INITIAL LIQUIDITY LOCK
   - Consider locking LP tokens for trust
   - Use Team Finance or similar service
   - Shows commitment to holders

3. CONTRACT OWNERSHIP
   - Deploy from wallet you control
   - Can transfer ownership later
   - Keep deployer wallet secure

4. PRICE STABILITY
   - Initial price = BUSD amount / TTX amount
   - More liquidity = less price volatility
   - Can add more liquidity anytime

5. MARKETING
   - Have Twitter account ready
   - Prepare Telegram group
   - Write announcement post
   - Create logo/branding

================================================================================
CHECKLIST FOR NEXT SESSION:
================================================================================

□ MetaMask installed and configured
□ BSC network added to MetaMask
□ Deployer wallet created with BNB
□ $10K+ BUSD ready in deployer wallet
□ Private key saved securely
□ Hardhat installed (we'll do together)
□ Contract code reviewed and ready
□ Trading announcement prepared

================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE DEPLOYING:
================================================================================

1. What initial price do you want? (Recommended: $0.05-0.10)
2. How much liquidity to start with? (Recommended: $10K-50K)
3. Lock liquidity or keep flexible? (Lock = more trust)
4. Deploy to mainnet or testnet first? (Testnet = practice)

================================================================================
